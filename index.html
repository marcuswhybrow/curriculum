<p>This section contains information on curriculum requirements for state schools. The state sector comprises maintained schools, academies and Free Schools.</p>

<p>The requirements for maintained schools are set out in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/primary-curriculum-subjects">primary curriculum subjects</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/secondary-curriculum-subjects">secondary curriculum subjects</a> sections.</p>

<p>The specific curriculum requirements for academies are set out in their funding agreements. Generally, academies and Free Schools are required to provide a broad and balanced curriculum to include English, maths and science and to make provision for the teaching of religious education. Beyond this they have the freedom to design a curriculum which meets their pupilsâ€™ needs, aspirations and interests.</p>

Further information about the National Curriculum review can be found in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/review-of-the-national-curriculum">Review of National Curriculum</a> section.</p>
