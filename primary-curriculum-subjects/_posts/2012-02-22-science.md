The statutory programme of study for science at Key Stages 1 and 2, and the attainment target level descriptions are accessible from these pages.

<h1 id="key-stage-1">Key Stage 1</h1>

During Key Stage 1 pupils observe, explore and ask questions about living things, materials and phenomena. They begin to work together to collect evidence to help them answer questions and to link this to simple scientific ideas. They evaluate evidence and consider whether tests or comparisons are fair. They use reference materials to find out more about scientific ideas. They share their ideas and communicate them using scientific language, drawings, charts and tables.

The science Key Stage 1 curriculum consists of:

* [Sc1 Scientific enquiry](#ks1-sc1-scientific-enquiry)

* Sc2 Life processes and living things

* Sc3 Materials and their properties

* Sc4 Physical processes

* Breadth of study
