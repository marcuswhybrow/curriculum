The statutory programme of study for geography at Key Stages 1 and 2, and the attainment target level descriptions are accessible from these pages.

<h1 id="key-stage-1">Key Stage 1</h1>

Teaching should ensure that 'geographical enquiry and skills' are used when developing 'knowledge and understanding of places, patterns and processes', and 'environmental change and sustainable development'.

During Key Stage 1 pupils investigate their local area and a contrasting area in the United Kingdom or abroad, finding out about the environment in both areas and the people who live there. They also begin to learn about the wider world. They carry out geographical enquiry inside and outside the classroom. In doing this they ask geographical questions about people, places and environments, and use geographical skills and resources such as maps and photographs.

<h3 id="ks1-geographical-enquiry-and-skills">Geographical enquiry and skills</h3>


1. In undertaking geographical enquiry, pupils should be taught to:


    1. ask geographical questions [for example, 'What is it like to live in this place?']


    1. observe and record [for example, identify buildings in the street and complete a chart]


    1. express their own views about people, places and environments [for example, about litter in the school]


    1. communicate in different ways [for example, in pictures, speech, writing].


2. In developing geographical skills, pupils should be taught to:


    1. use geographical vocabulary [for example, hill, river, motorway, near, far, north, south]


    1. use fieldwork skills [for example, recording information on a school plan or local area map]


    1. use globes, maps and plans at a range of scales [for example, following a route on a map]


    1. use secondary sources of information [for example, CD-ROMs, pictures, photographs, stories, information texts, videos, artefacts]


    1. make maps and plans [for example, a pictorial map of a place in a story].

<h3 id="ks1-knowledge-and-understanding-of-places">Knowledge and understanding of places</h3>


3. Pupils should be taught to:


    1. identify and describe what places are like [for example, in terms of landscape, jobs, weather]


    1. identify and describe where places are [for example, position on a map, whether they are on a river]


    1. recognise how places have become the way they are and how they are changing [for example, the quality of the environment in a street]


    1. recognise how places compare with other places [for example, compare the local area with places elsewhere in the United Kingdom]


    1. recognise how places are linked to other places in the world [for example, food from other countries].

<h3 id="ks1-knowledge-and-understanding-of-patterns-and-processes">Knowledge and understanding of patterns and processes</h3>


4. Pupils should be taught to:


    1. make observations about where things are located [for example, a pedestrian crossing near school gates] and about other features in the environment [for example, seasonal changes in weather]


    1. recognise changes in physical and human features [for example, heavy rain flooding fields].

<h3 id="ks1-knowledge-and-understanding-of-environmental-change-and-sustainable
development">Knowledge and understanding of environmental change and sustainable
development</h3>


5. Pupils should be taught to:


    1. recognise changes in the environment [for example, traffic pollution in a street]


    1. proved and sustained [for example, by restricting the number of cars].

<h2 id="ks1-breadth-of-study">Breadth of study</h2>


6. During the key stage, pupils should be taught the knowledge, skills and understanding through the study of two localities:


    1. the locality of the school


    1. a locality either in the United Kingdom or overseas that has physical and/or human features that contrast with those in the locality of the school.


7. In their study of localities, pupils should:


    1. study at a local scale


    1. carry out fieldwork investigations outside the classroom.

<h1 id="key-stage-2" class="reset-numbering">Key Stage 2</h1>

Teaching should ensure that 'geographical enquiry and skills' are used when developing 'knowledge and understanding of places, patterns and processes', and 'environmental change and sustainable development'.

During Key Stage 2 pupils investigate a variety of people, places and environments at different scales in the United Kingdom and abroad, and start to make links between different places in the world. They find out how people affect the environment and how they are affected by it. They carry out geographical enquiry inside and outside the classroom. In doing this they ask geographical questions, and use geographical skills and resources such as maps, atlases, aerial photographs and ICT.

    1. collect and record evidence [for example, by carrying out a survey of shop functions and showing them on a graph]


    1. analyse evidence and draw conclusions [for example, by comparing population data for two localities]


    1. identify and explain different views that people, including themselves, hold about topical geographical issues [for example, views about plans to build an hotel in an overseas locality]


    1. communicate in ways appropriate to the task and audience [for example, by writing to a newspaper about a local issue, using email to exchange information about the locality with another school].


2. In developing geographical skills, pupils should be taught:

    1. recognise and explain patterns made by individual physical and human features in the environment [for example, where frost forms in the playground, the distribution of hotels along a seafront]


    1. recognise some physical and human processes [for example, river erosion, a factory closure] and explain how these can cause changes in places and environments.

<h3 id="ks2-knowledge-and-understanding-of-environmental-change-and-sustainable
development">Knowledge and understanding of environmental change and sustainable
development</h3>


5. Pupils should be taught to:


    1. recognise how people can improve the environment [for example, by reclaiming derelict land] or damage it [for example, by polluting a river], and how decisions about places and environments affect the future quality of people's lives


    1. recognise how and why people may seek to manage environments sustainably, and to identify opportunities for their own involvement [for example, taking part in a local conservation project].

<h2 id="ks2-breadth-of-study">Breadth of study</h2>


6. During the key stage, pupils should be taught the knowledge, skills and understanding through the study of two localities and three themes:

    <h3 id="ks2-localities">Localities</h3>


    1. a locality in the United Kingdom


    1. a locality in a country that is less economically developed

    <h3 id="ks2-themes">Themes</h3>


    1. water and its effects on landscapes and people, including the physical features of rivers [for example, flood plain] or coasts [for example, beach], and the processes of erosion and deposition that affect them


    1. how settlements differ and change, including why they differ in size and character [for example, commuter village, seaside town], and an issue arising from changes in land use [for example, the building of new housing or a leisure complex]


    1. an environmental issue, caused by change in an environment [for example, increasing traffic congestion, hedgerow loss, drought], and attempts to manage the environment sustainably [for example, by improving public transport, creating a new nature reserve, reducing water use].


7. In their study of localities and themes, pupils should:


    1. study at a range of scales - local, regional and national


    1. study a range of places and environments in different parts of the world, including the United Kingdom and the European Union


    1. carry out fieldwork investigations outside the classroom.

<h1 id="attainment-target-level-descriptions">Attainment target level descriptions</h1>

<h2 id="level-1">Level 1</h2>

Pupils show their knowledge, skills and understanding in studies at a local scale. They recognise and make observations about physical and human features of localities. They express their views on features of the environment of a locality. They use resources that are given to them, and their own observations, to ask and respond to questions about places and environments.

<h2 id="level-2">Level 2</h2>

Pupils show their knowledge, skills and understanding in studies at a local scale. They describe physical and human features of places, and recognise and make observations about those features that give places their character. They show an awareness of places beyond their own locality. They express views on the environment of a locality and recognise how people affect the environment. They carry out simple tasks and select information using resources that are given to them. They use this information and their own observations to help them ask and respond to questions about places and environments. They begin to use appropriate geographical vocabulary.

<h2 id="level-3">Level 3</h2>

Pupils show their knowledge, skills and understanding in studies at a local scale. They describe and compare the physical and human features of different localities and offer explanations for the locations of some of those features. They are aware that different places may have both similar and different characteristics. They offer reasons for some of their observations and for their views and judgements about places and environments. They recognise how people seek to improve and sustain environments. They use skills and sources of evidence to respond to a range of geographical questions, and begin to use appropriate vocabulary to communicate their findings.

<h2 id="level-4">Level 4</h2>

Pupils show their knowledge, skills and understanding in studies of a range of places and environments at more than one scale and in different parts of the world. They begin to recognise and describe geographical patterns and to appreciate the importance of wider geographical location in understanding places. They recognise and describe physical and human processes. They begin to understand how these can change the features of places, and how these changes affect the lives and activities of people living there. They understand how people can both improve and damage the environment. They explain their own views and the views that other people hold about an environmental change. Drawing on their knowledge and understanding, they suggest suitable geographical questions, and use a range of geographical skills from the Key Stage 2 or 3 programme of study to help them investigate places and environments. They use primary and secondary sources of evidence in their investigations and communicate their findings using appropriate vocabulary.

<h2 id="level-5">Level 5</h2>

Pupils show their knowledge, skills and understanding in studies of a range of places and environments at more than one scale and in different parts of the world. They describe and begin to explain geographical patterns and physical and human processes. They describe how these processes can lead to similarities and differences in the environments of different places and in the lives of people who live there. They recognise some of the links and relationships that make places dependent on each other. They suggest explanations for the ways in which human activities cause changes to the environment and the different views people hold about them. They recognise how people try to manage environments sustainably. They explain their own views and begin to suggest relevant geographical questions and issues. Drawing on their knowledge and understanding, they select and use appropriate skills and ways of presenting information from the Key Stage 2 or 3 programme of study to help them investigate places and environments. They select information and sources of evidence, suggest plausible conclusions to their investigations and present their findings both graphically and in writing.

<h2 id="level-6">Level 6</h2>

Pupils show their knowledge, skills and understanding in studies of a wide range of places and environments at various scales, from local to global, and in different parts of the world. They describe and explain a range of physical and human processes and recognise that these processes interact to produce the distinctive characteristics of places. They describe ways in which physical and human processes operating at different scales create geographical patterns and lead to changes in places. They appreciate the many links and relationships that make places dependent on each other. They recognise how conflicting demands on the environment may arise and describe and compare different approaches to managing environments. They appreciate that different values and attitudes, including their own, result in different approaches that have different effects on people and places. Drawing on their knowledge and understanding, they suggest relevant geographical questions and issues and appropriate sequences of investigation. They select a range of skills and sources of evidence from the Key Stage 3 programme of study and use them effectively in their investigations. They present their findings in a coherent way and reach conclusions that are consistent with the evidence.

<h2 id="level-7">Level 7</h2>

Pupils show their knowledge, skills and understanding in studies of a wide range of places and environments at various scales, from local to global, and in different parts of the world. They describe interactions within and between physical and human processes, and show how these interactions create geographical patterns and help change places and environments. They understand that many factors, including people's values and attitudes, influence the decisions made about places and environments, and use this understanding to explain the resulting changes. They appreciate that the environment in a place and the lives of the people who live there are affected by actions and events in other places. They recognise that human actions, including their own, may have unintended environmental consequences and that change sometimes leads to conflict. They appreciate that considerations of sustainable development affect the planning and management of environments and resources. With growing independence, they draw on their knowledge and understanding to identify geographical questions and issues and establish their own sequence of investigation. They select and use accurately a wide range of skills from the Key Stage 3 programme of study. They evaluate critically sources of evidence, present well argued summaries of their investigations and begin to reach substantiated conclusions.

<h2 id="level-8">Level 8</h2>

Pupils show their knowledge, skills and understanding in studies of a wide range of places and environments at various scales, from local to global, and in different parts of the world. They offer explanations for interactions within and between physical and human processes. They explain changes in the characteristics of places over time, in terms of location, physical and human processes, and interactions with other places. They begin to account for disparities in development and understand the range and complexity of factors that contribute to the quality of life in different places. They recognise the causes and consequences of environmental issues and understand a range of views about them and different approaches to tackling them. They understand how considerations of sustainable development can affect their own lives as well as the planning and management of environments and resources. They use examples to illustrate this. Drawing on their knowledge and understanding, they show independence in identifying appropriate geographical questions and issues, and in using an effective sequence of investigation. They select a wide range of skills from the Key Stage 3 programme of study and use them effectively and accurately. They evaluate critically sources of evidence before using them in their investigations. They present full and coherently argued summaries of their investigations and reach substantiated conclusions.

<h2 id="exceptional-performance">Exceptional performance</h2>

Pupils show their knowledge, skills and understanding in studies of a wide range of places and environments at the full range of scales, from local to global, and in different parts of the world. They explain complex interactions within and between physical and human processes. They refer to a wide range of geographical factors to explain and predict change in the characteristics of places over time. They understand alternative approaches to development and the implications of these for the quality of life in different places. They assess the relative merits of different ways of tackling environmental issues and justify their views about these different approaches. They understand how considerations of sustainable development can affect their own lives as well as the planning and management of environments and resources. They illustrate this with a full range of examples. They draw selectively on geographical ideas and theories, and use accurately a wide range of appropriate skills and sources of evidence from the Key Stage 3 programme of study. They carry out geographical investigations independently at different scales. They evaluate critically sources of evidence and present coherent arguments and effective, accurate and well-substantiated conclusions. They evaluate their work by suggesting improvements in approach and further lines of enquiry.
